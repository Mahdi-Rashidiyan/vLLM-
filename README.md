# vLLM Exploration Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`vLLM.ipynb`) for exploring and experimenting with the [vLLM library](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About This Project

This project aims to provide a hands-on guide or demonstration of vLLM's capabilities. The `vLLM.ipynb` notebook likely contains code examples for:

*   Loading LLMs using vLLM.
*   Performing inference (text generation) with different sampling parameters.
*   Exploring vLLM's performance benefits.
*   Other relevant vLLM features.

## Key Files

*   `vLLM.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with code examples and explanations for using the vLLM library.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will likely need:

*   Python 3.8+
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
*   The vLLM library installed (`pip install vllm`)
*   Access to Hugging Face model weights or other compatible model sources, depending on the notebook's content.
*   Sufficient hardware (GPU recommended for optimal performance with LLMs).

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mahdi-Rashidiyan/vLLM-.git
    cd vLLM-
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then install vLLM and Jupyter:
    ```bash
    pip install vllm jupyterlab # or jupyter notebook
    ```
    *(Refer to the official [vLLM installation guide](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) for detailed instructions, especially regarding CUDA versions if using NVIDIA GPUs.)*

3.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  **Open and run `vLLM.ipynb`:**
    Navigate to the `vLLM.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface and execute the cells to see the demonstrations.

## Notebook Content (Assumed)

The `vLLM.ipynb` notebook might cover topics such as:

*   Basic setup and installation checks.
*   Loading different types of LLMs compatible with vLLM.
*   Simple text generation examples.
*   Using various sampling techniques (temperature, top-p, top-k).
*   Batch inference.
*   Showcasing speed and memory efficiency (if benchmarks are included).
